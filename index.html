            <div class="story">
                <p>growing up I had two disjointed memories.</p>
                <p>the first, was using a now-defunct website called <a href="https://cyrogem.itch.io/the-thoughts-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Thoughts Room</a> when i was worried or annoyed.  sometimes i preferred it to journaling -  my negative words never persisted, and i could watch each fading character lighting up a star in the virtual night.</p>
                <p>the second, was going to a guyanese temple in queens as a teenager. over the years i saw prayers to agni, the god of fire; inhaling smoke, i watched rituals to feed a burning flame over hours. i'm not sure what the people around me were praying for when they did this. a wish for a better life? a cleansing of sin? or maybe someone (something) that would listen.</p>
                <p>i wanted to combine these memories into a small interactive experience to give more positive energy on the internet. type out your thoughts and watch them dissolve into the fire. the more thoughts you give, the longer it'll last. no one will see what you write here. </p>
                <p>thanks for coming ~</p>
