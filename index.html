                <p>growing up I had two disjointed memories.</p>
                <p>the first, was using a now-defunct website called The Thoughts Room to let go of negative thoughts or stressful emotions. no one saw what i typed, and each fading character lit up a star in the virtual night.</p>
                <p>the second, was going to a guyanese hindu temple and experiencing agni prayers - rituals to feed a burning flame over hours. a prayer for a better life, cleansing of sin, or just someone (something) to listen to you.</p>
                <p>i wanted to combine these memories into a interactive experience. are you stressed? anxious? type out your thoughts and watch them dissolve into the fire. the more thoughts you give, the longer it'll last. </p>
                <p>no one will see or care what you write. hopefully you can use this as a safe space of sorts before going back out into the scary overstimulating internet or the real world.</p>
